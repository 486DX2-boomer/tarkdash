Helpful information for playing EFT.

## Dev branch only

Customizable links functionality is partially implemented, still requires the following:

1. Save and load custom settings to user's local storage (LoadUserSavedSettings.tsx), App.tsx lines 13-14
2. Add New ➕ button
3. Delete ❌ button

Total visual design rework, font, color scheme, icons, and header logo

Remove youtube pane (not really useful), make that the dedicated widget pane (with current USD/RUB converter, and more to come)

Fix @tarkov twitter feed being the wrong size for its pane
