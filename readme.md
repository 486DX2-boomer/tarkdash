# Tarkdash

Helpful information for playing EFT.

## Dev branch only

Customizable links functionality is partially implemented, still requires the following:

- [x] Save and load custom settings to user's local storage (LoadUserSavedSettings.tsx), App.tsx lines 13-14
- [x] Add New ➕ button
- [x] Delete ❌ button
- [x] Remove youtube pane (not really useful), make that the dedicated widget pane (with current USD/RUB converter, and more to come)
- [x] About page, acknowledgements/thank you page (such as tarkov.dev for providing API access)
- [ ] Import and export custom settings to other devices
- [ ] Total visual design rework, font, color scheme, icons, and header logo
- [ ] Fix @tarkov twitter feed always being the wrong height for its pane
